notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We do have several types of notifications.

quest related

There are two roles, hero and quest creator.

- as hero: pending, canceled, accepted, active, waiting for documentation, gained exp
- as quest creator: You have created a new quest, a hero is awaiting a response,
  a quest is waiting for the start signal, a quest is waiting for a "done" signal,
  a quest is awaiting documentation

Once a hero gets a new achievement, create notification once
